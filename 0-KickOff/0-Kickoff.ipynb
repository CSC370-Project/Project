    "To implement Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) in a program, several key aspects need to be considered, including data acquisition, mathematical modeling, optimization algorithms, and user interface elements. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the necessary components:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Data Acquisition\n",
    "- **Historical Price Data**: Collect historical price data for the assets in the portfolio. This data is typically sourced from financial data providers such as Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, or Quandl.\n",
    "- **Risk-free Rate**: Obtain the current risk-free rate, often represented by government bond yields (e.g., 10-year Treasury bond rate).\n",
    "- **Market Data**: For some advanced models, you might also need market indices data for benchmarking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Mathematical Modeling\n",
    "- **Expected Returns**: Calculate the expected returns for each asset based on historical data. This can be done using methods such as the arithmetic mean or geometric mean of historical returns.\n",
    "- **Covariance Matrix**: Compute the covariance matrix of asset returns to understand how the assets' returns move relative to each other.\n",
    "- **Portfolio Returns and Variance**: Develop formulas to calculate the expected return and variance of a portfolio based on the weights of the assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Optimization Algorithms\n",
    "- **Efficient Frontier**: Implement algorithms to generate the efficient frontier, which is the set of optimal portfolios offering the highest expected return for a defined level of risk.\n",
    "- **Optimization Techniques**: Use optimization techniques such as:\n",
    "  - **Quadratic Programming**: Commonly used for mean-variance optimization to find the minimum variance portfolio.\n",
    "  - **Linear Programming**: For certain types of constraints and objective functions.\n",
    "  - **Heuristic Methods**: For more complex or non-convex optimization problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Constraints Handling\n",
    "- **Budget Constraint**: Ensure that the sum of the portfolio weights equals 1.\n",
    "- **Non-Negativity**: Often, portfolios are constrained to no short-selling, meaning weights must be non-negative.\n",
    "- **Other Constraints**: Allow for additional constraints such as maximum or minimum weights for certain assets, sector constraints, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Risk Measures\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation**: Use standard deviation as a measure of portfolio risk.\n",
    "- **Other Measures**: Consider other risk measures like Value at Risk (VaR) or Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for more sophisticated risk assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. User Interface\n",
    "- **Input Interface**: Provide an interface for users to input their preferences, such as the list of assets, risk tolerance, investment horizon, etc.\n",
    "- **Output Interface**: Display the optimized portfolio, including asset weights, expected return, risk (standard deviation), and other relevant metrics.\n",
    "- **Visualization**: Use charts and graphs to visualize the efficient frontier, portfolio allocation, and risk-return profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Programming Languages and Libraries\n",
    "- **Programming Languages**: Common choices include Python, R, MATLAB, and Excel/VBA.\n",
    "- **Libraries**:\n",
    "  - **Python**: `numpy` for numerical calculations, `pandas` for data manipulation, `scipy` for optimization, `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization, `cvxopt` or `pyportfolioopt` for optimization routines.\n",
    "  - **R**: `quantmod` for data acquisition, `PerformanceAnalytics` for performance and risk analysis, `quadprog` for quadratic programming.\n",
    "\n",

    "            results[1,i] = portfolio_volatility\n",
    "            results[2,i] = (portfolio_return - 0.01) / portfolio_volatility\n",
    "            weights_record.append(weights)\n",
    "        return results, weights_record\n",
    "\n",
